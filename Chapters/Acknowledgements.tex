  \textsc{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}

First and foremost I want to thank all my co-authors of~\cite{RNEW} who contributed a more than significant part to this thesis with their research and feedback in the original paper.
Without them, I would have not only had a much harder time finding related literature but also had a significant drop in quality in the first version of this thesis.
Special thanks goes out to Manuel Penschuck and Alexander Leonhardt who took on the cruel job of supervising and supporting me in the early stages of this research.
Discussions with them were not only always very fruitful but also enjoyable.
Both of them also set aside significant time to proofread this thesis.
I also want to thank Holger Dell, Manuel Penschuck, and Alexander Leonhardt whose independent work yielded a template for this thesis.
I finally want to thank my friends and family and especially my girlfriend for supporting me along the way and allowing me to cool off with them when I needed to.
