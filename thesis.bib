  abstract  = {Given a set of N cities, with every two linked by a road, and the times required to traverse these roads, we wish to determine the path from one given city to another given city which minimizes the travel time. The times are not directly proportional to the distances due to varying quality of roads and varying quantities of traffic. The functional equation technique of dynamic programming, combined with approximation in policy space, yields an iterative algorithm which converges after at most (N — 1) iterations.}

  abstract = {A cornerstone of statistical inference, the maximum entropy framework is being increasingly applied to construct descriptive and predictive models of biological systems, especially complex biological networks, from large experimental data sets. Both its broad applicability and the success it obtained in different contexts hinge upon its conceptual simplicity and mathematical soundness. Here we try to concisely review the basic elements of the maximum entropy principle, starting from the notion of ‘entropy’, and describe its usefulness for the analysis of biological systems. As examples, we focus specifically on the problem of reconstructing gene interaction networks from expression data and on recent work attempting to expand our system-level understanding of bacterial metabolism. Finally, we highlight some extensions and potential limitations of the maximum entropy approach, and point to more recent developments that are likely to play a key role in the upcoming challenges of extracting structures and information from increasingly rich, high-throughput biological data.}

  abstract = {Online social networks are a source of sharing information and maintaining personal contacts with other people through social interactions and thus forming virtual communities online. Social networks are crowded with positive and negative relations. Positive relations are formed by support, endorsement and friendship and thus, create a network of well-connected users whereas negative relations are a result of opposition, distrust and avoidance creating disconnected networks. Due to increase in illegal activities such as masquerading, conspiring and creating fake profiles on online social networks, exploring and analyzing these negative activities becomes the need of hour. Usually negative ties are treated in same way as positive ties in many theories such as balance theory and blockmodeling analysis. But the standard concepts of social network analysis do not yield same results in respect of each tie. This paper presents a survey on analyzing negative ties in social networks through various types of network analysis techniques that are used for examining ties such as status, centrality and power measures. Due to the difference in characteristics of flow in positive and negative tie networks some of these measures are not applicable on negative ties. This paper also discusses new methods that have been developed specifically for analyzing negative ties such as negative degree, and h∗ measure along with the measures based on mixture of positive and negative ties. The different types of social network analysis approaches have been reviewed and compared to determine the best approach that can appropriately identify the negative ties in online networks. It has been analyzed that only few measures such as Degree and PN centrality are applicable for identifying outsiders in network. For applicability in online networks, the performance of PN measure needs to be verified and further, new measures should be developed based upon negative clique concept.}

  abstract  = {Despite disillusioning worst-case behavior, classic algorithms for single-source shortest-paths (SSSP) like Bellman-Ford are still being used in practice, especially due to their simple data structures. However, surprisingly little is known about the average-case complexity of these approaches. We provide new theoretical and experimental results for the performance of classic label-correcting SSSP algorithms on graph classes with non-negative random edge weights. In particular, we prove a tight lower bound of $\Omega$(n2) for the running times of Bellman-Ford on a class of sparse graphs with O(n) nodes and edges; the best previous bound was $\Omega$(n4/3{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}$\epsilon$). The same improvements are shown for Pallottino's algorithm. We also lift a lower bound for the approximate bucket implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm from $\Omega$(n logn / loglogn) to $\Omega$(n1.2{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}$\epsilon$). Furthermore, we provide an experimental evaluation of our new graph classes in comparison with previously used test inputs.}

  abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}

  abstract = {Most complex real world networks display scale-free features. This characteristic motivated the study of numerous random graph models with a power-law degree distribution. There is, however, no established and simple model which also has a high clustering of vertices as typically observed in real data. Hyperbolic random graphs bridge this gap. This natural model has recently been introduced by Krioukov et al. (in Phys Rev E 82(3):036106, 2010) and has shown theoretically and empirically to fulfill all typical properties of real world networks, including power-law degree distribution and high clustering. We study cliques in hyperbolic random graphs G and present new results on the expected number of k-cliques $$mathbb {E}left[ K_kright] $$EKk and the size of the largest clique $$omega (G)$$\'{z}(G). We observe that there is a phase transition at power-law exponent $$beta = 3$$β=3. More precisely, for $$beta in (2,3)$$β\'{z}(2,3) we prove $$mathbb {E}left[ K_kright] =n^{k (3-beta )/2} varTheta (k)^{-k}$$EKk=nk(3-β)/2\'{z}(k)-k and $$omega (G)=varTheta (n^{(3-beta )/2})$$\'{z}(G)=\'{z}(n(3-β)/2), while for $$beta geqslant 3$$β\'{z}3 we prove $$mathbb {E}left[ K_kright] =n , varTheta (k)^{-k} $$EKk=n\'{z}(k)-k and $$omega (G)=varTheta (log (n)/ log log n)$$\'{z}(G)=\'{z}(log(n)/loglogn). Furthermore, we show that for $$beta geqslant 3$$β\'{z}3, cliques in hyperbolic random graphs can be computed in time $$mathcal {O}(n)$$O(n). If the underlying geometry is known, cliques can be found with worst-case runtime $$mathcal {O}(m cdot n^{2.5})$$O(m·n2.5) for all values of $$beta $$β.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a new data structure for implementing heaps (priority queues). Our structure, Fibonacci heaps (abbreviated F-heaps), extends the binomial queues proposed by Vuillemin and studied further by Brown. F-heaps support arbitrary deletion from an n-item heap in O(log n) amortized time and all other standard heap operations in O(1) amortized time. Using F-heaps we are able to obtain improved running times for several network optimization algorithms. In particular, we obtain the following worst-case bounds, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges in the problem graph: O(n log n + m) for the single-source shortest path problem with nonnegative edge lengths, improved from O(mlog(m/n+2)n);  O(n2log n + nm) for the all-pairs shortest path problem, improved from O(nm log(m/n+2)n);  O(n2log n + nm) for the assignment problem (weighted bipartite matching), improved from O(nmlog(m/n+2)n);  O(mβ(m, n)) for the minimum spanning tree problem, improved from O(mlog log(m/n+2)n); where β(m, n) = min {i | log(i)n ≤ m/n}. Note that β(m, n) ≤ log*n if m ≥ n.  Of these results, the improved bound for minimum spanning trees is the most striking, although all the results give asymptotic improvements for graphs of appropriate densities.},

On a network with n vertices, m edges, and nonnegative integer arc costs bounded by C, a one-level form of radix heap gives a time bound for Dijkstra's algorithm of O(m + n log C). A two-level form of radix heap gives a bound of O(m + n log C/log log C). A combination of a radix heap and a previously known data structure called a Fibonacci heap gives a bound of O(m + na @@@@log C). The best previously known bounds are O(m + n log n) using Fibonacci heaps alone and O(m log log C) using the priority queue structure of Van Emde Boas et al. [ 17].},

  abstract = { Large real-world networks are typically scale-free. Recent research has shown that such graphs are described best in a geometric space. More precisely, the Internet can be mapped to a hyperbolic space such that geometric greedy routing is close to optimal [M. Bogun͂á, F. Papadopoulos, and D. Krioukov, Nature Commun., 1 (2010), pp. 1--62]. This observation has pushed the interest in hyperbolic networks as a natural model for scale-free networks. Hyperbolic random graphs follow a power law degree distribution with controllable exponent \$\beta\$ and show high clustering [L. Gugelmann, K. Panagiotou, and U. Peter, Proceedings of the 39th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming, 2012, pp. 573--585]. For understanding the structure of the resulting graphs and for analyzing the behavior of network algorithms, the next question is bounding the size of the diameter. The only known explicit bound is \$\mathcal{O}((\log n)^{32/((3-\beta)(5-\beta)) + 1})\$ [M. Kiwi and D. Mitsche, Proceedings of ANALCO, 2015, pp. 26--39]. We present two much simpler proofs for an improved upper bound of \$\mathcal{O}((\log n)^{2/(3-\beta)})\$ and a lower bound of \$\Omega(\log n)\$. If \$\beta > 3\$, we show that the latter bound is tight by proving an upper bound of \$\mathcal{O}(\log n)\$ for the diameter. }

    abstract = {We introduce fast algorithms for selecting a random sample of n records without replacement from a pool of N records, where the value of N is unknown beforehand. The main result of the paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm Z; it does the sampling in one pass using constant space and in O(n(1 + log(N/n))) expected time, which is optimum, up to a constant factor. Several optimizations are studied that collectively improve the speed of the naive version of the algorithm by an order of magnitude. We give an efficient Pascal-like implementation that incorporates these modifications and that is suitable for general use. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that Algorithm Z outperforms current methods by a significant margin.},

  abstract = {Parallel processing is not so mysterious a concept as the dearth of algorithms which explicitly use it might suggest. As a rule of thumb, if N processes are performed and the outcome is independent of the order in which their steps are executed, provided that within each process the order of steps is preserved, then any or all of the processes can be performed simultaneously, if conflicts arising from multiple access to common storage can be resolved. All the elements of a matrix sum may be evaluated in parallel. The ith summand of all elements of a matrix product may be computed simultaneously. In an internal merge sort all strings in any pass may be created at the same time. All the coroutines of a separable program may be run concurrently.},
